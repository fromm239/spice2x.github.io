<h2>about spice2x</h2>
<p>spice2x is a fork of SpiceTools, focused on addressing bugs, usability, and quality-of-life improvements</p>

<p>spice2x binaries are meant to be drop-in replacements for existing installs (spice.exe, spice64.exe, spicecfg.exe).</p>

<p>We are not associated with the original SpiceTools developers.
  SpiceCompanion apps are also separate projects owned by the app developers.
</p>

<p>Efforts will be made to keep up to date with upstream changes.</p>

<h2>beta downloads</h2>

<p>Last updated on: October 29th, 2023.</p>

<p>Note that while beta releases are mostly stable, there may be some bugs. If you experience any issues, please
  use the most recent stable release. Additionally, some of the new features and option flags may change. It is
  recommended that you back up the config file (%appdata%\spicetools.xml). These builds will be "promoted" to
  stable once they have been thoroughly tested.

    <ul>
      <li>
        -iidxsounddevice setting will now be automatically configured. Leave things to default settings
        (or "auto"), then Spice will try to pick the correct option between wasapi and asio.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are seeing audio issues or crashes with IIDX after updating to this version, please double
        check your audio options; in particular, -iidxsounddevice and -iidxasio. Also check log.txt for
        any messages regarding audio.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the past, LDJ used WASAPI, and TDJ used ASIO as the default (as in, we left the game decide on launch).
        This was a source of a lot of confusion & crashes, especially since btools uses WASAPI as the default.
        Starting with this version, Spice will always default to WASAPI, unless -iidxasio is also set, or if
        you actually have an Asus Xonar AE card (detection via the registry), then ASIO will be used. You can still
        override the option to "wasapi" or "asio" if needed, but it should not be necessary.

      <li>Fix bug with spicecfg not launching in some cases...</li>
      <li>If you have set your model code to "TDJ" by modifying ea3-config.xml, spicecfg will no longer crash
        if you update to this version. That being said, you should not be doing that in the first place!
        There is some bad guide out there that suggests people to change "LDJ" to "TDJ". Not only this doesn't actually
        turn on lightning mode, it actively breaks the game in many ways... so please don't ever do this, and instead
        just use the -iidxtdj option.

<h2>known issues</h2>

<p>
  Some anti-virus software may (incorrectly) flag the binaries as malware. If you have concerns, you are free to
  inspect the included source files and compile on your own.
</p>

<p>
  Gitadora boots but hangs trying to display card-in scene on some AMD Ryzen processors - e.g., 3900X, 5950X, and others.
  This is a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/838">known hardware issue</a>. 
  As a workaround, try disabling SMT in the BIOS, or try Process Affinity option in spice2x and limit the game to half the processors
  available.
</p>

<p>
  EG may launch at wrong refresh rate when using the auto-rotate option. Please enable -9on12 and -graphics-force-refresh to work around this.
</p>

<p>
  When in windowed mode, resizing the window also resizes the overlay, which may cause it to be difficult to use.
  Additionally, there is also no linear filtering that can be enabled in windowed mode.
  It's unlikely that these issues will be solved in the future.
</p>

<p>
  Multi-monitor games (TDJ, VM, etc) don't play nice with -monitor option. As a workaround, change the primary monitor before launching.
</p>

<p>
  Multi-monitor games (TDJ, VM, etc) don't work well with windowed mode (-w). Namely, interacting with subscreen will not work as expected.
  Please use full screen mode.
</p>

<h2>applying patches (hex edits)</h2>

<p>
  Patches are not being updated. Please use <a href="https://mon.im/bemanipatcher/">Bemani Patcher</a> or other similar sites.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to have patches show up in Patch Manager in the overlay, please follow these instructions:
  <ol>
    <li>Create patches.json. For an example, download this file: <a href="/patches.json">patches.json</a></li>
    <li>Modify the file, following the format. Note that dataOffset field is in decimal, not hex.</li>
    <li>Place the file next to Spice executables. The game will load it automatically.</li>
