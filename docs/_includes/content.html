<h2>about spice2x</h2>
<p>spice2x is a fork of SpiceTools, focused on addressing bugs, usability, and quality-of-life improvements</p>

<p>spice2x binaries are meant to be drop-in replacements for existing installs (spice.exe, spice64.exe, spicecfg.exe).</p>

<p>We are not associated with the original SpiceTools developers.
  SpiceCompanion apps are also separate projects owned by the app developers.
</p>

<p>Efforts will be made to keep up to date with upstream changes.</p>

<h2>beta downloads</h2>

<p>Last updated on: November 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>Note that while beta releases are mostly stable, there may be some bugs. If you experience any issues, please
  use the most recent stable release. Additionally, some of the new features and option flags may change. It is
  recommended that you back up the config file (%appdata%\spicetools.xml). These builds will be "promoted" to
  stable once they have been thoroughly tested.
